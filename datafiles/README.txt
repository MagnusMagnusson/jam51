Emergency Cleanup Service: High Octane Action (if you ignore the unfinished bits)
by Mr. Magn√∫s.

This is a very bodged together game that was mostly an experiment in making a 3D game in Gamemaker.
As such it's a bit barebones, the AI racers don't really work all that well,
and we're missing a lot of features I'd have liked to include had I had one more day. 
Just pretend you have access to a nitro boost, and it should all come together.
